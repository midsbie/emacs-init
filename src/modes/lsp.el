;;; Installation:
;;
;; TYPESCRIPT
;; 1. Install `typescript-language-server` for javascript and typescript
;;    support, as per documentation at:
;;    https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server
;;
;;    $ npm install -g typescript-language-server
;;
;; CSHARP
;; 1. Install the `mono-complete` system package:
;;    $ sudo apt install mono-complete
;;
;; 2. Install the omnisharp-roslyn LSP server:
;;    M-x lsp-install-server RET csharp RET
;;
;; 3. The Omnisharp Roslyn server bundles its own minimal Mono runtime,
;;    libraries and will prevent code instrospection and other LSP features
;;    from working as expected.  Fix this by symlinking to the system's Mono
;;    packages:
;;    $ cd ~/.emacs.d/.cache/lsp/omnisharp-roslyn/latest/omnisharp-roslyn/lib
;;    $ rm -rf mono
;;    $ ln -s /usr/lib/mono
