;;; Commentary:

;; This module configures the Vertico package.
;;
;; The configuration used initially was lifted verbatim from
;; https://github.com/minad/vertico#configuration .

;;; Code:

(use-package vertico
  :init
  ;; Different scroll margin
  ;; (setq vertico-scroll-margin 0)

  ;; Show more candidates
  (setq vertico-count 20)

  ;; Grow and shrink the Vertico minibuffer
  ;; (setq vertico-resize t)

  ;; Optionally enable cycling for `vertico-next' and `vertico-previous'.
  ;; (setq vertico-cycle t)
  :config
  (vertico-mode))

;; A few more useful configurations...
(use-package emacs
  :init
  ;; Add prompt indicator to `completing-read-multiple'.
  ;; We display [CRM<separator>], e.g., [CRM,] if the separator is a comma.
  (defun my/crm-indicator (args)
    (cons (format "[CRM%s] %s"
                  (replace-regexp-in-string
                   "\\`\\[.*?]\\*\\|\\[.*?]\\*\\'" ""
                   crm-separator)
                  (car args))
          (cdr args)))
  (advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :filter-args #'my/crm-indicator)

  ;; Do not allow the cursor in the minibuffer prompt
  (setq minibuffer-prompt-properties
        '(read-only t cursor-intangible t face minibuffer-prompt))
  (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'cursor-intangible-mode)

  ;; Emacs 28: Hide commands in M-x which do not work in the current mode.
  ;; Vertico commands are hidden in normal buffers.
  ;; (setq read-extended-command-predicate
  ;;       #'command-completion-default-include-p)
  )
