;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; VMS support.
;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------

;;; efs has full support for VMS hosts, including tree dired support.  It
;;; should be able to automatically recognize any VMS machine. However, if it
;;; fails to do this, you can use the command efs-add-vms-host.  As well,
;;; you can set the variable efs-vms-host-regexp in your .emacs file. We
;;; would be grateful if you would report any failures to automatically
;;; recognize a VMS host as a bug.
;;;
;;; Filename Syntax:
;;;
;;; For ease of *implementation*, the user enters the VMS filename syntax in a
;;; UNIX-y way.  For example:
;;;  PUB$:[ANONYMOUS.SDSCPUB.NEXT]README.TXT;1
;;; would be entered as:
;;;  /PUB$$:/ANONYMOUS/SDSCPUB/NEXT/README.TXT;1
;;; i.e. to log in as anonymous on ymir.claremont.edu and grab the file:
;;;  [.CSV.POLICY]RULES.MEM
;;; you would type:
;;;  C-x C-f /anonymous@ymir.claremont.edu:CSV/POLICY/RULES.MEM
;;;
;;; A legal VMS filename is of the form: FILE.TYPE;##
;;; where FILE can be up to 39 characters
;;;       TYPE can be up to 39 characters
;;;       ## is a version number (an integer between 1 and 32,767)
;;; Valid characters in FILE and TYPE are A-Z 0-9 _ - $
;;; $ cannot begin a filename, and - cannot be used as the first or last
;;; character.
;;;
;;; Tips:
;;; 1. To access the latest version of file under VMS, you use the filename
;;;    without the ";" and version number. You should always edit the latest
;;;    version of a file. If you want to edit an earlier version, copy it to a
;;;    new file first. This has nothing to do with efs, but is simply
;;;    good VMS operating practice. Therefore, to edit FILE.TXT;3 (say 3 is
;;;    latest version), do C-x C-f /ymir.claremont.edu:FILE.TXT. If you
;;;    inadvertently do C-x C-f /ymir.claremont.edu:FILE.TXT;3, you will find
;;;    that VMS will not allow you to save the file because it will refuse to
;;;    overwrite FILE.TXT;3, but instead will want to create FILE.TXT;4, and
;;;    attach the buffer to this file. To get out of this situation, M-x
;;;    write-file /ymir.claremont.edu:FILE.TXT will attach the buffer to
;;;    latest version of the file. For this reason, in tree dired "f"
;;;    (dired-find-file), always loads the file sans version, whereas "v",
;;;    (dired-view-file), always loads the explicit version number. The
;;;    reasoning being that it reasonable to view old versions of a file, but
;;;    not to edit them.
;;; 2. EMACS has a feature in which it does environment variable substitution
;;;    in filenames. Therefore, to enter a $ in a filename, you must quote it
;;;    by typing $$. There is a bug in EMACS, in that it neglects to quote the
;;;    $'s in the default directory when it writes it in the minibuffer.  You
;;;    must edit the minibuffer to quote the $'s manually. Hopefully, this bug
;;;    will be fixed in EMACS 19. If you use Sebastian Kremer's gmhist (V 4.26
;;;    or newer), you will not have this problem.
