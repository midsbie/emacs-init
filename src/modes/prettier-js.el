;;; Commentary:

;; Try the following steps when troubleshooting issues:
;;
;; (1) `prettier-restart' after making changes to a repository's `.prettierrc'
;;     file.
;;
;; (2) `prettier-info' to verify prettier's configuration.
;;
;; Note that `prettier-mode' now bundles a base64-encoded compressed version of
;; prettier (follow references to file "prettier-el.js.gz.base64" in
;; `prettier--create-process') rather than execute prettier's script and that it
;; may produce different results compared to a project's installed version if
;; the versions mismatch significantly.

;;; Code:

(defgroup init/prettier-mode nil
  "Customisations for `prettier-mode'."
  :group 'init
  :prefix "init/prettier-mode")

(defcustom init/enable-prettier-mode nil
  "Enable `prettier-mode'.

Specifies whether `prettier-mode' should always be enabled in
all JS/X buffers."
  :group 'init/prettier-mode
  :type 'boolean)

(defun init/prettier-mode/maybe-enable ()
  "Turn on `prettier-mode' selectively.

This function checks if the current buffer's file is within a repository
that has a local Prettier installation (i.e., the prettier executable is
found in the relative path \"node_modules/.bin/prettier\"). If so,
`prettier-mode' is enabled.

Note that enabling of the mode is deferred to resolve an issue where
some .prettierrc settings are ignored when formatting the buffer on
save. Strangely this only happens when LSP is active."
