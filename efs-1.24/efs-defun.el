;;; (it's copylefted) and warranty (there isn't one) information.

;;; efs-defun allows object-oriented emacs lisp definitions.
;;; In efs, this feature is used to support multiple host types.
;;; 
;;; The first arg after the function name is a key which determines
;;; which version of the function is being defined. Normally, when the function
;;; is called this key is given as the first argument to the function.
;;;
;;; For example:
;;; 
;;; (efs-defun foobar vms (x y)
;;;   (message "hello vms world")
;;;   (+ x y))
;;;   => foobar
;;;
;;; (foobar 'vms 1 2)
;;;   => 3

;;; The key nil plays a special role: 
;;;
;;; First, it defines a default action. If there is no function
;;; definition associated with a given OS-key, then the function
;;; definition associated with nil is used.  If further there is no
;;; function definition associated with nil, then an error is
;;; signaled.  
;;;
;;; Second, the documentation string for the function is the one given
;;; with the nil definition. You can supply doc-strings with other
;;; definitions of the function, but they are not accessible with
;;; 'describe-function. In fact, when the function is either loaded or
;;; byte-compiled, they are just thrown away.

;;; There is another way to define the default action of an efs-function.
;;; This is with the use flag. If you give as the key (&use foobar),
;;; then when the function is called the variable foobar will be used to
;;; determine which OS version of the function to use. As well as
;;; allowing you to define the doc string, if the use flag is used,
;;; then you can specify an interactive specification with the function.
;;; Although a function is only interactive, if the default definition
;;; has an interactive spec, it is still necessary to give interactive
;;; specs for the other definitions of the function as well. It is possible
;;; for these interactive specs to differ.
;;; 
;;; For example:
;;; 
;;; (efs-defun fizzle (&use foobar)
;;;   "Fizzle's doc string."
;;;   (interactive)
;;;   (message "fizz wizz"))
;;; 
;;; (efs-defun fizzle vms
;;;   (interactive)
;;;   (message "VMS is fizzled."))
;;; 
;;; (setq foobar 'unix)
;;; => unix
;;; 
;;; (fizzle)
;;; => "fizz wizz"
;;; 
;;; (setq foobar 'vms)
;;; => vms
;;; 
;;; (fizzle)
;;; => "VMS is fizzled."
;;; 
;;; M-x f i z z l e <return>
;;; => "VMS is fizzled."
;;;
;;; Actually, when you use the &use spec, whatever follows it is simply
;;; evaluated at call time.

;;; Note that when the function is defined, the key is implicitly
;;; quoted, whereas when the function is called, the key is
;;; evaluated.  If this seems strange, think about how efs-defuns
;;; are used in practice.

;;; There are no restrictions on the order in which the different OS-type
;;; definitions are done.

;;; There are no restrictions on the keys that can be used, nor on the
;;; symbols that can be used as arguments to an efs-defun.  We go
;;; to some lengths to avoid potential conflicts. In particular, when
;;; the OS-keys are looked up in the symbol's property list, we
;;; actually look for a symbol with the same name in the special
;;; obarray, efs-key-obarray. This avoids possible conflicts with
;;; other entries in the property list, that are usually accessed with
;;; symbols in the standard obarray.

;;; The V19 byte-compiler will byte-compile efs-defun's.
;;; The standard emacs V18 compiler will not, however they will still
;;; work, just not at byte-compiled speed.

;;; efs-autoload works much like the standard autoload, except it
;;; defines the efs function cell for a given host type as an autoload.
;;; The from-kbd arg only makes sense if the default action of the autoload
;;; has been defined with a &use.

;;; To do:
;;;
;;; 1. Set an edebug-form-hook for efs-defun

;;; Known Bugs:
;;;
;;; 1. efs-autoload will correctly NOT overload an existing function
;;;    definition with an autoload definition. However, it will also
;;;    not overload a previous autoload with a new one. It should. An
;;;    overload can be forced for the KEY def of function FUN by doing
;;;    (put 'FUN (intern "KEY" efs-key-obarray) nil) first.
