;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; CMS support
;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------

;;; efs has full support, including tree dired support, for hosts running
;;; CMS.  It should be able to automatically recognize any CMS machine.
;;; We would be grateful if you would report any failures to automatically
;;; recognize a CMS host as a bug.
;;; 
;;; This should also work with CMS machines running SFS (Shared File System).
;;; 
;;; Filename syntax:
;;;
;;; CMS filenames are entered in a UNIX-y way. In otherwords, minidisks are
;;; treated as UNIX directories. For example to access the file READ.ME in
;;; minidisk *.311 on cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu, you would enter
;;;   /anonymous@cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu:/*.311/READ.ME
;;; If *.301 is the default minidisk for this account, you could access
;;; FOO.BAR on this minidisk as
;;;   /anonymous@cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu:FOO.BAR
;;; CMS filenames are of the form FILE.TYPE, where both FILE and TYPE can be
;;; up to 8 characters. Again, beware that CMS filenames are always upper
;;; case, and hence must be entered as such.
;;;
;;; Tips:
;;; 1. CMS machines, with the exception of anonymous accounts, nearly always
;;;    need an account password. To have efs send an account password,
;;;    you can either include it in your .netrc file, or use
;;;    efs-set-account.
;;; 2. efs-set-account can be used to set account passwords for specific
;;;    minidisks. This is usually used to optain write access to the minidisk.
;;;    As well you can put tokens of the form
;;;    minidisk <minidisk name> <password> in your .netrc file. There can be
;;;    as many minidisk tokens as you like, however they should follow all
;;;    other tokens for a given machine entry. Of course, ordinary ftp
;;;    will not understand these entries in your .netrc file.
;;;


;;; Since CMS doesn't have any full pathname syntax, we have to fudge
;;; things with cd's. We actually send too many cd's, but is dangerous
;;; to try to remember the current minidisk, because if the connection
;;; is closed and needs to be reopened, we will find ourselves back in
;;; the default minidisk. This is fairly likely since CMS ftp servers
;;; usually close the connection after 5 minutes of inactivity.

;;; Have I got the filename character set right?

;;; The following three functions are entry points to this file.
;;; They have been added to the appropriate alists in efs.el
