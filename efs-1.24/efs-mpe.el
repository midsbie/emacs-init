;;; This file is part of efs. See efs.el for copyright
;;; (it's copylefted) and warranty (there isn't one) information.

;;; Credits 
;;
;; Sandy Rutherford for his help and advice.

;;; Usage
;;
;; For a general description of remote file access see efs.el.
;;
;; MPE Specifics
;;
;; *) To make things easier (for me) MPE has been UNIXified so think UNIX 
;;    and you stand a good chance of understanding everything.
;;
;; *) Filename syntax is as follows
;;
;;    /session,user.account,group@system:/account/group/file;buildparms
;;    
;;    the "session," and ",group" in the logon sequence are optional.
;;
;;    e.g. /CDSUSER.OSCAR@SYSTEM41:/OSCAR/CDSSRC/TST0000S
;;    will get the file TST0000S.CDSSRC.OSCAR
;;
;;    The ";buildparms" is also optional. It should be used when creating
;;    files whos characteristics differ from the default system buildparms,
;;    described in the file FTPDOC.ARPA.SYS (at least it is on my system).
;;    Also see variable efs-mpe-default-buildparms.
;;
;;    e.g. REC=-256,,V,ASCII
;;
;; *) Password syntax is as follows
;;    
;;    userpass,accountpass,grouppass
;;
;;    Leading commas cannot be omitted, trailing commas can.
;;    e.g. USERPASS,ACCTPASS   (no group password)
;;         ,ACCTPASS           (only account password)
;;         USERPASS,,GRPPASS   (no account password)
;;
;; *) Do not use account name completion on large systems. See the variable
;;    efs-mpe-account-completion-confirm 
;;
;; *) Do not use group name completion on large accounts. See the variable
;;    efs-mpe-group-completion-confirm
;;
;; *) The buffers FILE and FILE;BUILDPARMS both point to the same physical
;;    disc file.
;;  
;; *) When using filename completion you will usually be given the option
;;    between FILE and FILE;BUILDPARMS. Just ignore the FILE;BUILDPARMS
;;    bit.
;;
;; *) WARNING ********* Two buffer for the same file ************ WARNING
;;    If you land up with two buffers FILE and FILE;BUILDPARMS for the same
;;    file kill the FILE;BUILDPARMS one. If however this is newwer than
;;    the FILE buffer (and you cannot live with a buffer called 
;;    FILE;BUILDPARMS) save it kill both buffers and get the FILE buffer again.
;;
;; *) When creating new files only create FILES. It is possible to create
;;    files as GROUPs and ACCOUNTs but don't!  
;;
;;; To Do
;;
;; A lot of things are likely to change with MPE 4.5 and POSIX so I do not want
;; to invest too much time in this now. I would rather wait until I can see
;; what comes with POSIX.
;;
;; Feel free to send bugs, suggestions for enhancements and enhancements
;; to me cdesouza@hpbbn.bbn.hp.com. If I have TIME I will try to deal with
;; them. Also I'm not a lisp programmer so keep it simple or put in plenty
;; of comments.
;;
;;
;; *) Improve on the dired GROUP and ACCOUNT listings.
;;
;; *) Add ".." to dired FILE and GROUP listings.
;;
;; *) Support POSIX (need POSIX machine first though).
;;
;; *) Test ACCOUNT name completion and listings properly. I have the problem
;;    that the only systems available to me are large ( i.e. start a listf
;;    @.@.@,2  today and come back tomorrow), which makes
;;    it pretty hard for me to test.
