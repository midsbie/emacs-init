;; NATIVE COMPILATION OPTIMIZATIONS
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; - Docs for `native-comp-speed' states that a speed of 3 can lead to

;; - Some users reported that passing "-O3" to the native compiler can lead to
;;   worse performance.

;;
;; Set higher threshold before GC kicks in. Changing this setting seems to make
;; emacs snappier for some specific workflows.
;;
;; It may be wise to set the GC threshold to a reasonable value or we may end up
;; hindering performance.  Might be best to have more frequent clean ups taking
;; an imperceptible amount of time to complete, rather less frequent ones that
;; momentarily block editing.
;;
;; Noting that on Emacs 29.0.90 it no longer seems possible to set this value.
