;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; MTS support
;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------

;;; efs has full support, including tree dired support, for hosts running
;;; the Michigan terminal system.  It should be able to automatically
;;; recognize any MTS machine. We would be grateful if you
;;; would report any failures to automatically recognize a MTS host as a bug.
;;;
;;; Filename syntax:
;;; 
;;; MTS filenames are entered in a UNIX-y way. For example, if your account
;;; was YYYY, the file FILE in the account XXXX: on mtsg.ubc.ca would be
;;; entered as
;;;   /YYYY@mtsg.ubc.ca:/XXXX:/FILE
;;; In other words, MTS accounts are treated as UNIX directories. Of course,
;;; to access a file in another account, you must have access permission for
;;; it.  If FILE were in your own account, then you could enter it in a
;;; relative path fashion as
;;;   /YYYY@mtsg.ubc.ca:FILE
;;; MTS filenames can be up to 12 characters. Like UNIX, the structure of the
;;; filename does not contain a TYPE (i.e. it can have as many "."'s as you
;;; like.) MTS filenames are always in upper case, and hence be sure to enter
;;; them as such! MTS is not case sensitive, but an EMACS running under UNIX
;;; is.
