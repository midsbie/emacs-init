;;;; CMS support for KNET-VM server
;;;; ------------------------------------------------------------

;;; efs has full support, including tree dired support, for hosts running
;;; CMS.  It should be able to automatically recognize any CMS machine.
;;; We would be grateful if you would report any failures to automatically
;;; recognize a CMS host as a bug.
;;; 
;;; Filename syntax:
;;;
;;; KNET/VM Support (J. M. Schwarz, Mar 12, 1994):
;;; This code has been developed and tested with 
;;; "KNET/VM FTP server Release 3.2.0" by Spartacus.
;;;
;;; This server uses not only a different listing format than the one used in
;;; efs-cms.el, but also handles minidisks differently. 
;;; The cd command for changing minidisk is not supported, 
;;; instead a full filename syntax "FILENAME.FILETYPE.FM" is used, where
;;; FM is the filemode. To access a file "PROFILE EXEC A0", efs uses a
;;; syntax "/cms-hostname:/A:/PROFILE.EXEC"   (Note the ':')
;;; 
;;; In this directory notation, "/A0:" is actually a subset of the "/A:"
;;; directory.
