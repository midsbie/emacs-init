Installation Instructions
=========================

NOTE: These instructions only apply if you're installing EFS under the
      FSF's Emacs or under XEmacs 19 or 20.

      If you have XEmacs 21, fetch the EFS package from the XEmacs
      distribution sites instead.

NOTE: EFS 1.24 requires Dired >=7.9 for proper operation.  Get it from
      the same place as EFS itself.

ANOTHER NOTE: For customization support, you need a reasonably recent
              of Per Abrahamsen's custom package. It comes with more
              recent versions of XEmacs and the FSF's Emacs.

              If you absolutely need to, get it from

              http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/

              Note that the custom package shipped with older versions
              of the FSF's Emacs and XEmacs is incompatible with EFS.
              See below for instructions on how to disable custom
              support.

1. Edit the configuration variables in Makefile below.
   EMACS should be the name of the emacs program on your system.
   EMACS_VERSION should be the emacs version. This must be one of:
     18     for all versions of Emacs 18.
     19     for all versions of the original GNU Emacs from FSF between
            19.1 and 19.22, inclusive.
     19.23  for version 19.23 and later of the original GNU Emacs from FSF
     l19.11 for XEmacs 19.11 trhu 19.14
     x19.15 for XEmacs 19.15
     x20    for XEmacs 20.1 and later
   IGNORE_CUSTOM= should be '-l $(CWD)/cust-stub.el' if you want to
   disable custom support.
   LISPDIR should be the directory in which you want the .elc
     files installed.
   BDIR should be the directory containing the .elc files for the
     byte-compiler.  Although efs byte-compiles and works with the
     Emacs V18 byte-compiler, it is strongly recommended to use
     Jamie Zawinski's V19 byte-compiler. This byte-compiler is
     standard with Lucid Emacs, XEmacs, and GNU Emacs V19, so in this
     case you can set BDIR to nothing.
   INFODIR should be the directory where you want the Texinfo
   documentation to go.
   DIREDDIR should be set to the directory containing the .elc files for
     Dired.  Be sure to have a version later than 7.9.
   VMDIR should be set to the directory containing the .elc files for
     VM. If you aren't using VM, then set this to nothing.
   CUSTOMDIR should be set to the directory containing the .elc files for
     custom. If your Emacs comes with custom, ignore this option.

2. To byte-compile the entire package, except for VM support (efs-vm.el),
   run

      make EMACS_VERSION

   where EMACS_VERSION is the emacs version that you are
   compiling for.  It must be one of:

   18     for Emacs 18
   19     for the original GNU Emacs from FSF, versions 19.1 through
            19.22, inclusive
   19.23  for the original GNU Emacs from FSF, version 19.23 and later.
   l19.11 for Lucid XEmacs 19.11 thru 19.14
   x19.15 for XEmacs 19.15
   x20    for XEmacs 20.1 and later

   If you have set the EMACS_VERSION variable correctly, then typing just    

   make

   will suffice.

3. To byte-compile everything, including VM support, run

   make all

4. To byte-compile all the efs files, except for VM support,
   run

   make efs

5. To byte-compile only the core efs files run

   make core

6. To byte compile an efs-XXX.el file, run

   make XXX.

   This means that VM support can be compiled by running make vm.

7. To byte-compile only efs-auto.el, for autoloading efs, run

   make auto

8. To install the compiled Lisp files and the info pages, run

   make install_elc

9. After loading, configure EFS via M-x customize RET efs
